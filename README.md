This is the repository for CAD files and various other design, manufacturing related plans for world's first open-source software & hardware collaboration that aims to create a high tech helmet.

Dragon Armor is a multidisciplinary engineering project that particularly focused on computer, electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineering. If you are willing to contribute then please visit [the project page](https://github.com/DragonComputer/DragonArmor/projects/1) to learn the TODOs.

If you are willing to fund the project then please contact the project lead via mert.yildiran@bil.omu.edu.tr

The CAD files (which are the files with .f3d and .f3z extensions) must be opened using [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview). The files with .f3z extension are the distributed designs, it means they are depended to other files so you need to import/upload all the files to your project. For **Dragon Helmet** for example [TheHelmet.f3z](https://github.com/DragonComputer/DragonArmor/blob/master/DragonHelmet/TheHelmet.f3z) is the main project file and it depends to all the other files located under [DragonArmor/tree/master/DragonHelmet](https://github.com/DragonComputer/DragonArmor/tree/master/DragonHelmet).
